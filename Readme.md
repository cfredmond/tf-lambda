# tf-lambda

tf-lambda provides a simple, easy-to-use starting point for creating and managing AWS Lambda resources using Terraform.

## Setup

1. Access the tf-lambda tool by visiting the following URL: https://github.com/cfredmond/tf-lambda/generate and generate your template.
2. Add your desired repository name, a brief and informative description (if desired), select the appropriate branch visibility setting, and then click the `Create repository from template` button to quickly and easily create a new repository using the selected template.
3. After creating your repository, clone it to your local system for easy access and editing.
4. Navigate to your cloned repository by using the cd command in your terminal, and then execute the following commands to setup a virtual enviorment.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/venv/bin/activate
```
5. Install any required packages and add your lambda code to the example.py file in the example folder.
6. Run the following command to package your lambda and its dependencies.
```
./package.sh
```
7. Initalize terraform and run the plan command.
```
terraform init
terraform plan
```
8. Carefully review the plan generated by the tool and make any necessary adjustments, then execute the command to run the plan and implement the desired changes.
```
terraform apply
```

By executing this command, you will package and deploy the contents of the example folder as a Lambda function on AWS, making it ready for use.
